                         The user enables the anti-passback feature on the reader, which requires a valid card for entry and exit. The card holder must use the card in the proper IN/OUT sequence--that is, a card swiped at an IN reader must then be swiped at an OUT reader, or vice versa--a card swiped at an OUT reader must then be swiped at an IN reader. If the user's IN/OUT sequence is invalid, then an anti-passback violation event is generated for the type of anti-passback chosen (Hard or Soft) and the card holder is either denied access (Hard) or allowed access (Soft).
						 <>
						
						<strong>Hard </strong>- Validates IN/OUT status before allowing entry. A second swipe of the card at the same type of reader (IN/OUT) causes a Hard anti-passback violation and the user is denied entry.
						</br><>

						<strong>Soft </strong>- Validates IN/OUT status before allowing entry. A second swipe of a card at the same type of reader (IN/OUT) causes a Soft anti-passback violation but the user is allowed entry.
						</br><>
						
						<strong>Out </strong>- Applies to readers located inside the anti-passback-controlled area. Card holders use these readers when attempting to exit the anti-passback-controlled area.
						</br><>
						
						<strong>In </strong>- Applies to readers located outside the anti-passback-controlled area. Card holders use these readers when attempting to enter the anti-passback-controlled area.
