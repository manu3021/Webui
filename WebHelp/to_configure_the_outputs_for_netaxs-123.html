            <li>In the MPC Dashboard area, click the <strong>Create & Edit</strong> tab. The <strong>CREATE AND EDIT</strong> page appears.</li>
			<li>In the left pane, select the site and then click the relevant device added to the site.</li>

				<h4 class="subtitle">Note:</h4>
				<p>Before you modify the device settings, ensure to register the devices on cloud.</p>

			<li>In the left pane, click the <i class="netaxs-icon"></i> icon corresponding to the NetAXS-123 device to expand and view all the available doors.</li>
			<li>Double-click the required door to expand and view all the associated outputs. The <strong>Settings </strong>page appears.</li>

                        Specifies two schedules:
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Energized </strong>– sets the period during which the output is automatically energized.</li>
								<li><strong>Disable Interlock </strong>– sets the period during which the interlock, a programmed interaction between selected inputs, outputs and groups will be disabled. During the selected Time Zone this point ignores all interlock actions to it, effectively disabling it from being a Reacting Component during the Time Zone.</li>
							</ul>
						
						Outside of the Time Zone the point will react to interlocks as expected.
